# SchedCal
A web interface for calculating cpu scheduling time based on different scheduling algorithms.
Available at: https://schedule-peach.vercel.app/





FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE PROJECT
• Process Scheduling Algorithms are implemented.
• Each process can have different number of CPU Burst Time and I/O Burst Time.
• Gantt Chart and Timeline Chart for the given Schedule.
• Context Switching Time.
• Animation of the Time Log.
• Comparison for Round Robin Algorithm for all time quantum.
• Comparison between all the algorithms with respect to Average Completion Time,
Turn Around Time, Waiting Time and Response Time.
